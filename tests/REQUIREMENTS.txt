WHAT ARE THE DEVELOPER REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------------------

This file provides instructions about the what and how to install the preliminary tools to be able to run the developer
version of the TRANSADÃ© application. We will assume that the computer you are using is new.
Simply skip a step if its execution isn't required.


STEP I: jdk
-----------
First you will have to make sure that the jdk is installed on your computer.
I'm currently using jdk7.** . Use the following link:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html

STEP II: scala editor & compiler
--------------------------------
After making sure that your jdk has been correctly installed, you will have to install an editor to read the scala files
compile and execute the scala classes. There are a few editors recommended online. 3 of the most common editors are
IntelliJ, eclipse or netbeans. With time i have however come to realise that the installation time and effort required
for the IntelliJ editor is less than the half of that required by the other editors. Thus we will focus on intelliJ.

Use the following link to download IntelliJ: http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/
I'm currently using IntelliJ IDEA 13.** (community version)
Once downloaded and installed, run the editor after than follow these instructions:
- press "strg" + "alt" + "s" on your keyboard OR go to the menu bar and click on "file" and click "settings"
- go to "plugins"
- click "browse repositories"
- enter the word "scala" in the upper right text field
- there should be a single entry as result (something with a version similar to 0.26.335)
- right click on it and choose "download and install". Once installed if your subsequent choices are appropriate
  the editor will restart and be ready to work.

STEP III: Install GIT
---------------------
Download the latest version from this server: http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list
It should be something like: Git-1.8.4-preview20130916.exe
Use the following tutorial to install it: http://uncod.in/blog/installing-msysgit-on-windows7/
It works for windows7 and windows8. To check if everything has been installed successfully:
press the windows start key and enter "puttygen". If you get a positive result than everything is ready to go.

STEP IV: Install TORTOISE GIT
-----------------------------
Download the latest stable version from this server: http://download.tortoisegit.org/tgit/
At this level it's important to know which bit level your computer has: 32bit or 64bit.
Use the following tutorial to install it: http://uncod.in/blog/installing-tortoisegit-on-windows7/
It works for windows7 and windows8.

STEP V: GITHUB
--------------
Once done
- go to https://github.com/
- create an account
- and send me your username (my email address is tapmeppe@gmail.com) or even easier look for the project and fork it.
  The project name is: transade.
