<!--The parse node summarises the adequate previously created transade.transfer.source.target.parse nodes
by listing all the parsed source column names. There can not be more than -3 nodes in total and -one node with the same status.
The status indicates how good or bad the parsing of the node was. The values available are:
- bad =: all badly parsed parse node are automatically exclude from the computation,
- poorly =: all poorly parsed parse node are improved as far as possible by the application before the computation,
- good =: everything is good to go.
